*Table and column option 

	Cassandra does not offer auto-incrementing primary keys; 
	each row, when created must be explicitely assigned parimary key by client.

	Does not have concept of nulls.

	Does not support default values

	Does not provide data validation like length of column.

	Basically cassandra assumes that above constraints are easily available / handelled at application level.


* The Type System

	Strings
		text (UTF-8) , ascii (bytes 0-127)

	Integers
		int (32-bit) 
		bigint (64-bit)
		varint (no limit)

	Floating point and decimal numbers
		float (32-bit)
		double (64-bit)
		decimal (no limit)

	Dates and times
		Timestamp
		uuid ( version 1 and version 4 UUID )
		timeuuid ( version 1 UUID ) , has functionality to convert between UUID and timestamp

		UUID Version 1
			generated using computers mac and high precision timestamp.

		UUID Version 4
			generated with random number and pseudorandom numbers

	Booleans

	Blobs
		image, audio, enctrypted data.


* Inserts.
	In cassandra columns with values only takes spaces.


* Paginating through results.
	We can not use where clause directly on primary key, as it does not store primary key as it is.
	To query on primary key column , we need to use token() function.

	ALLOW FILTERING, if we want to filter restults with non partition column.


* Mental model of cassandra till now.
	Key value store.
